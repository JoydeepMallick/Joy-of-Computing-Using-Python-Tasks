While the last few years have proven that things can go wildly wrong at a moment’s notice, it’s hard to look at the projected 2022 video game release schedule and not get excited about what’s shaping up to be one of the best video game years ever.

While there are a few games scheduled for release in 2022 that we’ve been looking forward to for years now, it’s the depth of the year’s lineup that really sets it apart. While we’re still waiting for several of the year’s biggest games to finally get release dates (and delays are obviously always a possibility), there’s a very good chance that every month this year will feature multiple new releases that will end up being in the game of the year conversation.

Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, though, let’s take a look at some of the biggest upcoming releases in 2022 and why you should have many of these games on your calendar and wishlist.
